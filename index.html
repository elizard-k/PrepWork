        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>3 cups semisweet chocolate chips (about 18 ounces)</li>
                <li>1 can sweetened condensed milk (14 ounces)</li>
                <li>½ cup unsalted butter (1 stick), cut into pieces</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1 cup chopped walnuts</li>
                <li>Pinch of salt</li>
            </ul>    
        </div>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Line an 8-inch square baking pan with parchment paper or foil, leaving some overhang on the sides. Lightly butter or spray the lining to prevent sticking.</li>
            <li>In a medium saucepan over low heat, combine the chocolate chips, condensed milk, and butter. Stir constantly until everything is melted and smooth. Be careful not to let the mixture boil.</li>
            <li>Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the vanilla extract and a pinch of salt. Fold in the walnuts until evenly mixed.</li>
            <li>Pour the mixture into the prepared pan, smoothing the top with a spatula. Let it cool at room temperature for about 1 hour, then refrigerate for at least 2 hours or until firm.</li>
            <li>Once set, lift the fudge out of the pan using the parchment overhang and cut into neat 1-inch squares.</li>
        </ol>
